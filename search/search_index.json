Program Mechanism \u00b6 A protein or protein complex structure is broken down into pieces, usually amino acid residues and cofactors. Each piece may have charge, protonation, and position conformers. These peices interact with each other, and the piece conformers are sampled by Monte Carlo sampling to find their probabilty of occupancy at various conditions, such as pH, redox potention, chemical potential, and introduced charges.

The detailed steps are illustrated in the following example: Create an issue on group repo \u00b6 Tell others what you are working on by creating an issue. To create an issue, go to https://github.com/GunnerLab/Develop-MCCE , and create a new issue. After an issue is created, a number will be returned. Create a branch on local repo \u00b6 Suppose I am going to write code to address the issue created by someone else or myself, and the issue number is #30. The issue title is \"Develop script to install Mkdocs and recommended plugins\" Now I go to the forked repo directory on my local computer, make sure I have remote referenc set up correctly: ( base ) jmao@vivo:~/projects/Develop-MCCE$ git remote -v origin https://github.com/newbooks/Develop-MCCE.git ( fetch ) origin https://github.com/newbooks/Develop-MCCE.git ( push ) upstream https://github.com/GunnerLab/Develop-MCCE.git ( fetch ) upstream https://github.com/GunnerLab/Develop-MCCE.git ( push ) Before I create a branch, update the master from upstream so all existing code is up to date. ( base ) jmao@vivo:~/projects/Develop-MCCE$ git checkout master Already on 'master' Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 7 commits. ( use \"git push\" to publish your local commits ) ( base ) jmao@vivo:~/projects/Develop-MCCE$ git pull upstream master From https://github.com/GunnerLab/Develop-MCCE * branch master -> FETCH_HEAD Already up to date. It's time to create a new local branch that matches the issue number: ( base ) jmao@vivo:~/projects/Develop-MCCE$ git checkout -b issue#30 Develop code under branch \u00b6 In this example, I create a file install_mkdocs.sh under bin. #!/bin/bash pip install --upgrade pip pip install bs4 pip install unicode pip install mkdocs pip install mkdocs-material pip install pymdown-extensions pip install markdown-blockdiag pip install markdown-include Go to wiki directory and run mkdocs serve Then point browser to URL http://localhost:8000 to monitor mkdocs page. If everything goes well, the documentation site should be up. Any edits under wiki will be reflected by the above page. When it is ready to deploy as a github page, run mkdocs gh - deploy This will create another branch, which is a special branch linked to Github page, and pushed to Github automatically. So in this example, I actually end up with two branches: issue#30 gh-pages (already pushed to Github by mkdocs gh-deploy ) We only need to manually commit and push branch issue#30 git add bin/ git commit -a -m \"Added script to install mkdocs. closes #30\" git push \"closes #30\" in commit will tell Github to close the issue #30 at the time of merging to the upstream. Create pull request \u00b6 After the changes are pushed to origin, go to your forked repository. Tips The most recently pushed branch should appear separately, and a button to create pull request next to it. This is a shortcut to make pull request. Under tab <> Code, change the branch to issue#30, then use the button on the right to make a new pull quest. The GunnerLab repo manager will review and approve your pull request. Clean up \u00b6 Once the pull request is approved, the changes are compiled into the master branch of the main repository, and the branch issue#30 in your fork and local repository can be deleted. Under your local repo, git checkout master # switch from branch to master git pull upstream master # sync from upstream git branch delete issue # 30 # delete the local issue branch git push origin --delete issue#30 # delete remote issue branch Now both the local and upstream repo have the up to date code.
